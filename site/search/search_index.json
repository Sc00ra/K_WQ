This study aims to improve the reliability of Sentinel-2 derived measurements by calibrating them with in-situ spectroradiometric data collected from selected inland waters in the Krak\u00f3w region. By integrating remote sensing with direct field observations, we enhance the precision of key water quality indicators. A dedicated measurement campaign will be conducted at two to three designated sites, where data collection will occur at regular intervals. Water samples will be taken near the shore and at the center of the water bodies to analyze key parameters such as colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), dissolved organic matter (DOM), chlorophyll-a (Chla), and turbidity. Simultaneously, meteorological conditions will be recorded to assess environmental influences on water quality indicators. The calibration process involves for example the application of linear regression models to correlate satellite-derived measurements with in-situ observations. The study aims to enhance the accuracy and reliability of remote sensing techniques for water quality monitoring. The findings will contribute to improved methodologies for assessing aquatic ecosystems, with potential applications for regional and global water quality management.</p>"},{"location":"superres/","title":"Super Resolution","text":""},{"location":"superres/#what-is-super-image-resolution","title":"What is Super Image Resolution","text":"<p>Super image resolution is a technique that enhances the spatial resolution of satellite images, allowing finer details to be extracted from medium-resolution data such as Sentinel-2. This is especially valuable in water quality monitoring, where detecting small features like narrow shorelines, small-scale pollution, or localized algae blooms can make a significant difference.</p> <p>In our project, we utilize the SEN2SR model developed by ESA OpenSR.
